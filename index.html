			<h1>"Translation" of blog page to Bootstrap</h1>

			<p class="blogPostNewOffice">
				I added the Bootstrap stylesheet to the body of my HTML. Then I 'translated' the HTML container and column set up I had originally to the Bootstrap vocabulary. I only did that for each of the two columns and that's it. At first the page shows the same as it did and when I shrink it the right column goes beneath the left column, but that's gone away so i just made the entire left column hide when it reaches a certain size.</p>

				<p>I was able to hide the callout using a Media query - it didn't work at first because I was linking my HTML file to the wrong CSS file. Caught it.</p>

				<p>I can point to the logo image, but can't get it to center using Margin:0 auto or anything else.</p> 

				<p>I can't get the left column to adjust to all 12 or the full width when shrinking the screen. Because I couldn't get it to work I simply made the entire colunm hide when it gets small.</p> 

				<p>However, I can't get the right column to squeeze in when the screen gets smaller.</p> 

				<p>Also the header photo gets weird as I make the screen smaller - it gets out of whack and eventually shrinks to nothing.</p>
